        <h2>TL;DR</h2>
        <br />
        What happens on Skolded.com, stays on Skolded.com.
        <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />
        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
        <br />
        This Privacy Policy describes how your personal information is collected, used, and shared when you visit Skolded (the "Site").
        <br /><br /><br />
        <h2>PERSONAL INFORMATION WE COLLECT</h2>
        <br />
        When you visit the Site, we automatically collect certain information about your device, including information about your web browser and some of the cookies that are installed on your device. Additionally, as you use the Site, we collect information about how you interact with the Site. We refer to this automatically-collected information as "Device Information".
        We collect Device Information using the following technologies:<br />
        - "Cookies" are data files that are placed on your device or computer and often include an anonymous unique identifier. For more information about cookies, and how to disable cookies, visit <a href="http://www.allaboutcookies.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">http://www.allaboutcookies.org</a>.<br />
        - "Log files" track actions occurring on the Site, and collect data including event types (such as log in, log out and password reset) and date/time stamps.<br />
        Additionally, when you register, we store your e-mail address, (optional) username and password. We also store e-mail addresses of users not previously registered, that you invite by sending them initial "punishments". During your activity, we store "punishments" ordered by each user, including statistics relevant to completing them (such as how much time a user spent trying to complete each "punishment"). We refer to this information as "Account Information".
        When we talk about "Personal Information" in this Privacy Policy, we are talking both about Device Information and Account Information.
        HOW DO WE USE YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION?
        We use the Personal Information that we collect to improve and optimize our Site (for example, by generating analytics about how our customers browse and interact with the Site, and to assess the success of our marketing and advertising campaigns).
        <br /><br /><br />
        <h2>SHARING YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION</h2>
        <br />
        We use Google Analytics to help us understand how our users use the Site. You can read more about how Google uses your Personal Information here: <a href="https://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/privacy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/privacy/</a>. You can also opt-out of Google Analytics here: <a href="https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout</a>.
        We may share your Personal Information to comply with applicable laws and regulations, to respond to a subpoena, search warrant or other lawful request for information we receive, or to otherwise protect our rights.
        Other than that, we do not share your Personal Information with third parties.
        <br /><br /><br />
        <h2>YOUR RIGHTS</h2>
        <br />
        If you are a European resident, you have the right to access personal information we hold about you and to ask that your personal information be corrected, updated, or deleted. If you would like to exercise this right, please contact us through the contact information below.
        Additionally, please note that your information will be transferred outside of Europe, including to the United States.
        <br /><br />
        <h2>DATA RETENTION</h2>
        <br />
        When you create (order) a "punishment", we will maintain submitted data (to allow you to browse the history of your "punishments" and to be able to show you your ranking in the "Skoldboard") until you ask us to delete this information.
        <br /><br /><br />
        <h2>CHANGES</h2>
        <br />
        We may update this privacy policy from time to time in order to reflect, for example, changes to our practices or for other operational, legal or regulatory reasons.
        <br /><br /><br />
